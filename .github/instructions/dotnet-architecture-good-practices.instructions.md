# DDD Systems & .NET Guidelines
...
## MANDATORY THINKING PROCESS

**BEFORE any implementation, you MUST:**

1.  **Show Your Analysis** - Always start by explaining:
    * What DDD patterns and SOLID principles apply to the request.
    * Which layer(s) will be affected (Domain/Application/Infrastructure).
    * How the solution aligns with ubiquitous language.
    * Security and compliance considerations.
2.  **Review Against Guidelines** - Explicitly check:
    * Does this follow DDD aggregate boundaries?
    * Does the design adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle?
    * Are domain rules encapsulated correctly?
    * Will tests follow the `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult()` pattern?
3. **Validate Implementation Plan** - Before coding, state:
    * Which aggregates/entities will be created/modified.
    * What domain events will be published.
    ...

## Core Principles

### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

* **Ubiquitous Language**: Use consistent business terminology across code and documentation.
* **Bounded Contexts**: Clear service boundaries with well-defined responsibilities.
* **Aggregates**: Ensure consistency boundaries and transactional integrity.
* **Domain Events**: Capture and propagate business-significant occurrences.
* **Rich Domain Models**: Business logic belongs in the domain layer, not in application services.

### 2. **SOLID Principles**

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

### 3. **.NET Good Practices**

* **Asynchronous Programming**: Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to ensure scalability.
* **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Leverage the built-in DI container to promote loose coupling and testability.
* **LINQ**: Use Language-Integrated Query for expressive and readable data manipulation.
* **Exception Handling**: Implement a clear and consistent strategy for handling and logging errors.
* **Modern C# Features**: Utilize modern language features (e.g., records, pattern matching) to write concise and robust code.

### 4. **Security & Compliance** 🔒

* **Domain Security**: Implement authorization at the aggregate level.
* **Financial Regulations**: PCI-DSS, SOX compliance in domain rules.
* **Audit Trails**: Domain events provide a complete audit history.
* **Data Protection**: LGPD compliance in aggregate design.
