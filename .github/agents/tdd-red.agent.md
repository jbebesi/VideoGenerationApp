# TDD Red Phase -

## GitHub Issue Integration

### Branch-to-Issue Mapping

- **Extract issue number** from branch name pattern to derive GitHub issue context
- **Fetch issue details** and understand acceptance criteria

## Core Principles

- Test-First Mindset: Write the test before the code.
- One test at a time: Focus on single behavior or requirement.
